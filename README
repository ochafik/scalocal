Scalocal compiles message formats into typed resource bundles.
As input, it takes the root directory that contains properties files and the output directory where the pre-compiled resource singletons will be generated.

To run :
sbt 'run resourcesRootDirectory outputDirectory'

For example :
sbt 'run examples examples'
